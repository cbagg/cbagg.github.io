# Welcome to my github.

I am data scientist currently working in the Minneapolis metro. I am a transplant from the Dallas area and have followed my career north. I am a lifelong learner driven by the wide array of problems businesses face that are ultimately solvable with data. 

My core values are simple.

* Good solutions and technology exist only with respect to the problems they solve. 
* There is no replacement for competency. Not even leadership skills or attitude.
* A positive attitude is almost always at least one required competency of any task.
* Innovative solutions usually come from unfamilar and even confusing spaces.
* Groups of people who respect each other's expertise always outperform the brilliant loner.
* There is no on/off switch at birth that determines a persons mathematical or technical acumen.
* Being intelligent is no substitute for being educated, but education can happen in or out of a classroom.
