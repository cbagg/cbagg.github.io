# Welcome to my github.

I am data science leader currently working in the Minneapolis metro. Though a transplant from the Dallas area, I have followed my career north. I am a lifelong learner driven by the wide array of problems businesses face that are ultimately solvable with data.

Like most economics majors, I imagined myself as a business owner; the training prepares one to understand the deep mechanics of pricing, optimization, and forecasting that are crucial. As I grew my career, I learned that most traditional business leaders do very little of this. Deep expertise in the mechanics of the business is often relegated downward to the lower levels of the company. I believe this is the fundamental reason most businesses are rife for disruption. 

Disruptors and entrepeneurs such as Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, Travis Kalanic, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and others have done in years what others tried for centuries, because they are fundamentally driven by a deep and abiding understanding of their business, technology, product, and customers. Traditional companies have taken a core part of their product, their technology & data asset, and treated as a non-critical understanding for leaders. While not being a CPA prevents one from being CFO, knowledge of technology and data does not bear the same impact to lead technology strategy and prioritize work.  

The best way to understand a company is through its data. Data is the method by which you mine insights, and analytics is the mere application of quantitative methods to strategic thought. Data driven companies must drive data literacy throughout every level of their organization to succeed.


My core values are simple.

* Good solutions and technology exist only with respect to the problems they solve. 
* There is no replacement for competency. Not even leadership skills or attitude.
* A positive attitude is almost always at least one required competency of any task.
* Innovative solutions usually come from unfamilar and even confusing spaces.
* Cohorts of people with expertise always outperform the brilliant loner.
* There is no flag at birth that determines mathematical or technical acumen.
* Intelligence is no substitute for knowledge, which schooling sometimes provides.
* It is impossible to fully understand a problem before trying to solve it.
* It is wise to surround yourself with people who are smarter than you.
* Easy work is often not worth doing. Gravitate to the challenge.
