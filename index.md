# Welcome to my github.

I am data scientist currently working in the Minneapolis metro. I am a transplant from the Dallas area and have followed my career north. I am a lifelong learner driven by the wide array of problems businesses face that are ultimately solvable with data. 

My core values are simple.

* Good solutions and technology exist only with respect to the problems they solve. 
* There is no replacement for competency. Not even leadership skills or attitude.
* A positive attitude is almost always at least one required competency of any task.
* Innovative solutions usually come from unfamilar and even confusing spaces.
* Cohorts of people with expertise always outperform the brilliant loner.
* There is no flag at birth that determines mathematical or technical acumen.
* Intelligence is no substitute for knowledge, which schooling sometimes provides.
